In fact, the face of Hollywood is changing. Sure, there are plenty of people with botox, plastic surgery, and platinum bleached hair to fill a stadium, but there are more people who simply look like real people. Many celebrities today are overweight, bear signs of aging, are of different ethnicities and body types. People are realizing that beauty comes in many different shapes and colors and nothing brought that home as Jamie Lee Curtis.</p><p>Jamie Lee Curtis simply stunned on the Golden Globes 2019 Red Carpet and made a statement that at 60-years-old you can age naturally, let your hair shine in its brilliance and be sensational and beautiful.</p><p>There was a time when a woman‚Äôs career in modeling or acting was said to be over at the age of 30. Jamie Lee Curtis has proved that wrong. Not only has she shown that a woman‚Äôs acting career can continue past the age of 30, but her 2018 success with Halloween showed that an older woman can star in a movie and lead the film to a box office success.</p><p>Halloween had a budget of 10 million and grossed 254 million worldwide, all under Jamie Lee Curtis‚Äô helm. Curtis‚Äô career is active and will next appear in the movie An Acceptable Loss that is set for release on January 18, 2019.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Canada loves you, too, <a href=# rel=nofollow>@jamieleecurtis</a> üá®üá¶ <a href=# rel=nofollow>#etalkredcarpet</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#goldenglobes</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/EIaXirysln</a></p><p>‚Äî Etalk (@etalkCTV) <a href=# rel=nofollow>January 6, 2019</a></p><p>Jamie Lee Curtis has two movies in post-production&nbsp;expected to be released in 2019. The first is Knives Out which will be released on November 27, 2019, and the second is Senior Entourage. Senior Entourage is slated for a 2019 release, but an exact date has not been announced.</p><p>She has three projects in development, two of which she serves as executive producer.</p><p>Jamie Lee Curtis‚Äô hair was a solid white compared to her traditional silver-shaded locks. Fan response to the new look was a success and fans quickly praised the look and Jamie‚Äôs ensemble on social media networks.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What did you think of Jame Lee Curtis‚Äô icy-white hair and her shocking-white dress? Do you find her pro-aging approach inspirational?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGealrqqsYylnJ5lk6q%2FtbXSZpmroZ6cwG680ahkmp%2BZo7RuwM5mq6GdXZy8rbDEp2SgpJ%2BXsrR51qKroWWXpL%2Bosc6uqmavmJ7BpnnHmqCrZZGjsW65wK2aoaGenHqmutKepJuklWJ%2FdH6RbGpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./news-valentina-ferrer-in-bathing-suit-is-a-power-house.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Valentina Ferrer in Bathing Suit is a &amp;quot;Power House&amp;quot; Celebwell</span></a>
