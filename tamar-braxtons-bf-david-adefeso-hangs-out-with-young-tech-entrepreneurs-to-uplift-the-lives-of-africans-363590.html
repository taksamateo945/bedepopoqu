I live here in Silicon Valley. Hope you enjoyed your stay. I would love to bump into you and @tamarbraxton here in Silicon Valley sometime. Love you guys!!😘’</p><p>He shared another video after his Silicone Valley trip which he captioned with the following words: ‘Me and @ojione made it back to LA after a terrific trip to Silicon Valley✈️ to set the table for some #bigdeals. I couldn’t have any of the famous Dungeness crab the Bay is known for😢😢 but the kind folks at this awesome Chinese Restaurant, Jade Cathay, made me the most amazing fried Vegan spring rolls…yummy😋😋. Thanks guys🙏🏽🙏🏽. I go hungry on many trips because I can’t always find vegan food, particularly when it’s a busy work trip.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7wcI9fnljr/</p><p>Other than this, David has been living his best life together with Tamar.</p><p>He managed to shock fans recently when <a href=#>he shared a photo with Tamar’s baby daddy, Vincent Herbert</a>.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>A few people could have imagined that Tamar’s current boyfriend could eventually become a friend of Vincent’s.
