When you stop enjoying the party and think about the hangover. At the time I was pretty low and finding it hard to enjoy anything without fearing its ending – so working on the production with <strong>Hoost</strong> I wanted the track to feel like you were having something taken away from you before you were ready to lose it.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Listen to ‘Sad on Sundays’ below:</strong></h4><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Still riding high from the success of his sold-out headline show at <strong><a href=#>The Old Blue Last</a></strong> in London, the release of ‘Sad on Sundays’ comes as Louis continues to make significant impact on TikTok!</p><p>Since exploding onto the platform with his rewrites of songs series ‘Written From The Other Perspective…’ (his version of Bruno Mars’ hit song ‘Talking to the Moon’ has to date attracted 16.5M views) the <a href=#>‘Things To Talk About’</a> singer has amassed over 647k followers and received more than 10.2M likes.</p><p>In acknowledgement of his ever-growing popularity on the platform, Louis was featured in TikTok’s nationwide billboard campaign <strong>Top 20 Unsigned Artists</strong> – whereby members of the public in major cities throughout the country where able to scan featured QR codes (as seen on various billboards and fly posters) that would take them directly to a dedicated showcase of unsigned artists on TikTok.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>As well as making his mark online, Louis continues to release a steady stream of new music as both a solo artist, and as a featured vocalist – with his latest collab <a href=#>‘Samba’</a> with German DJ and producer duo <strong><a href=#>YOUNOTUS</a></strong> gaining over 13 million plays on Spotify and reaching No.1 on the German airplay charts.</p><p>His previous releases include <a href=#>‘Walk Home’</a>, <a href=#>‘Killer’</a>, <a href=#>‘Fever Thoughts’</a> and <a href=#>‘Anywhere’</a> with UK dance-duo <strong>Sigma</strong> which to date has amassed more than 74 million streams on Spotify and gained a silver certification in the UK.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>‘Sad on Sundays’ is available to download / stream <a href=#>now</a>.</strong></h4><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Let us know your thoughts on Louis III over on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a> now!</strong></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kubDByKxkoqGZYrGzu8%2BsZJ6ln6m2t7GMp5ywZaOeu6i4xGaqmpxdpLtuv9Snm5qxo2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./doug-bradley.html><span>←</span><span>Doug Bradley Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
