The Underdog From The Underground made the hot tag to KO, who took out both brothers with a dive from the top rope to the floor.</p><p>The Usos almost hit the 1D on Zayn, but KO saved him by pulling Jey out of the ring. Jimmy and Jey ended up putting him through one of the announce tables. Moments later, they did hit Zayn with the 1D, but he kicked out to a huge pop.</p><p>The Prizefighter crawled back to the apron and tagged back in so he could hit Popup Powerbombs to both Usos. The tide changed a few more times before the match came to a close when Zayn tagged in and nailed Jey with the Helluva Kick three times for the win.</p><p>This match was great for both its in-ring action and storytelling. All four guys did a masterful job with everything, especially the selling of the big spots.</p><p>You could see people legitimately crying in the crowd as Zayn and Owens hugged with tears in their eyes. This was the perfect way to end Night 1 of WrestleMania 39.</p><p><b>Winners: </b>Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens</p><p><b>Notable Moments and Observations</b></p><ul class="atom bulletedList"><li>Lil Uzi Vert performed for a minute before The Usos made their entrance.&nbsp;</li><li>Not only did Zayn and Owens have matching gear, but they also had the PWG logo on it.&nbsp;</li><li>Owens as a tag team wrestler is great because he has one of the best hot tag sequences in WWE.&nbsp;</li><li>KO has such a clean frog splash.
