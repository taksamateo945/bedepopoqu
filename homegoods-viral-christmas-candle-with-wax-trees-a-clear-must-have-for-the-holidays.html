This will help prevent soot and ensure an even burn.</li><li><strong>Use a proper holder</strong>: Always use a holder that is designed for the size and shape of the candle. This will prevent the candle from tipping over and causing a fire.</li><li><strong>Keep away from flammable materials</strong>: Make sure the candle is placed on a stable surface away from curtains, furniture, and other flammable materials.</li><li><strong>Never leave a burning candle unattended</strong>: Always keep an eye on the candle while it is burning. Never leave it unattended, especially around children or pets.</li><li><strong>Extinguish the candle properly</strong>: Use a candle snuffer or a metal lid to extinguish the candle.
