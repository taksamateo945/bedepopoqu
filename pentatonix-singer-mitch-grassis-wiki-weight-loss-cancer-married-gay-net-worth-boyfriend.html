The group is extremely popular on YouTube, and their <a rel=nofollow href=#>official YouTube channel</a> has over 15 million subscribers. Do you want to read more about Mitch, from his early life to career beginnings and even find out who his boyfriend is? If yes, then stay with us for a while, as we are about to bring you closer to this up-and-coming music star.</p><h2><span id=Mitch_Grassi_Wiki_Early_Life_Parents_and_Education>Mitch Grassi Wiki: Early Life, Parents, and Education</span></h2>Of Italian, Irish, Scottish and Welsh ancestry, Mitch is the son of Mike and Nel Grassi. From an early age, Mitch was interested in the performing arts, and even before high school was known in his area as a talented singer and actor as well. Turning to musical theater and choirs, Mitch started meeting like children, including Kristin Maldonado and Scott Hoying, the latter becoming his best friend. Mitch attended Martin High School, where his skills were on display, as he, Kristin and Scott were members of an a cappella group called The Trio, and he appeared in a number of plays, including “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Mitch-Grassi-01.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.2x.jpg><h2><span id=Professional_Beginnings>Professional Beginnings</span></h2><p>It was in 2011 that Mitch felt the first rays of success, when two other members joined his group, and they officially became Pentatonix. Kevin Olusola and Avi Kaplan brought their own skills, and as a quintet they signed up for the new season of the Sing-Off contest. They were eventually named victors of the season, and with songs such as “E.T”, originally by Katy Perry, then “Love Lockdown” by Kanye West, and “Eye of the Tiger” by Survivor, won not just hearts of the judges, but also the public.</p><h2><span id=Rise_to_Prominence>Rise to Prominence</span></h2><p>After winning the show, Mitch and the group signed a contract with Madison Gate Records, and began recording their debut album. However, it was an EP that was released, entitled “PTX Volume 1” in June 2012, followed by another EP, “PTXmas”, which came out on the 13th November the same year. Before their debut full-length album was released, Pentatonix left Madison Gate Records to join with RCA Records, and their studio album “PTX, Vols. 1 & 2”, a compilation of the songs on their first and second EP, came out, but wasn’t as successful as the members thought it would be, but they continued recording new music in hopes for the best. It was their Christmas album that launched the group to stardom. Released on the 21st October 2014 under the title “That’s Christmas to Me”, it achieved double platinum status in the US and reached No. 2 on the US Billboard 200 chart. Since then, Pentatonix has released two more extremely successful albums “Pentatonix” (2015), and “A Pentatonix Christmas” (2016), both topping the US Billboard 200 chart and achieving gold and platinum status.</p><h2><span id=Further_Success>Further Success</span></h2><p>Most recently, Pentatonix released their fifth and sixth studio albums – “PXT Presents: Top Pop, Vol. I” and “Christmas Is Here”, on the 13th April and 26th October 2018, respectively. In addition to albums and tours across the US and Canada, the group is extremely popular on YouTube. When they were left without a contract, they turned to YouTube, and after just a few videos posted, Mitch and the rest of the group were on their way back to glory. Now they have over 15 million subscribers, and their videos have been viewed over 3.5 billion times.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Last day of tour with <a rel=nofollow href=#>@PTXofficial</a>.

So do you know how rich his success has made him? As of late 2018, authoritative sources estimate Mitch’s wealth at over $8 million, which is pretty impressive for a young star like him, right? Undoubtedly, this number will increase in the future, assuming that he and &nbsp;Pentatonix continue their successful career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2d3177a908eb42eb6ac6e331e6eeaee0.jpg><h2><span id=Mitch_Grassi_Cancer_Diagnosis_and_Weight_Loss>Mitch Grassi Cancer Diagnosis and Weight Loss</span></h2><p>In recent times, Mitch’s name has been viewed in the media numerous times; according to reports, Mitch is suffering from cancer, but more information hasn’t been given, except that the doctors have discovered this terrible illness at a rather early stage, and with chemotherapy the prognosis is that Mitch will be just fine.
