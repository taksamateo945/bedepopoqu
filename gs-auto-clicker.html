Once done, you can open and instantly start using the software. The interface of the program is old but simple. With just a few essential functions available on the screen, the app makes itself <strong>accessible to users who aren’t tech-savvy</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The app’s primary window consists of a large button with a message that asks users to press the F8 key on their keyboard to enable mouse clicks.

You can repeat this entire input later by clicking on the assigned hotkey. Because of this, the app’s ability to just click extends to an entire sequence that you can automate if you like.&nbsp;</p><h2>IS GS Auto Clicker free?</h2><p>One of the best parts about <strong>GS Auto Clicker download</strong> is that it’s completely free.
