His children are Jay Harbaugh, Jack Harbaugh, Addison Harbaugh, Katherine Harbaugh, Grace Harbaugh, John Harbaugh, and James Harbaugh.</strong></p><p>The Michigan Wolverines head coach has been married twice. His first marriage was to Miah Harbaugh and it lasted from 1996 to 2006. The ten-year union produced three children – Jay Harbaugh, Grace Harbaugh, and James Harbaugh. Sarah Feuerborn Harbaugh is the second woman Jim married and they tied the knot in 2008. The two are still together to date and welcomed four children – daughters Addison and Katherine, and sons Jack and John.</p><h2><strong>Meet Jim Harbaugh’s Children</strong></h2><h3><strong>Jay Harbaugh is Jim’s First Child</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> June 14, 1989</li><li><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;34 Years Old</li><li><strong>Profession:</strong> American football coach</li></ul><p>Born June 14, 1989, Jay Harbaugh is Jim Harbaugh and Miah Harbaugh’s first child together. Jay was born in San Diego, California, and his date of birth indicates that he was born a few years before his parents got married.</p><p>Jay Harbaugh is a graduate of St. Augustine High School where he played defensive line and would have launched an active football career if a knee injury didn’t end his playing days. He furthered his education at Oregon State University, earning a degree in Sociology.</p><p>Jay is currently an American football coach and his records are spread across different teams. He first worked as an undergraduate assistant at Oregon State for four seasons and spent three seasons under his uncle John Harbaugh at the Ravens. In 2015, he served as the tight ends coach of the Michigan football team and assistant special teams coach for the Wolverines. He has remained with the team to date.</p><p>Jim Harbaugh’s first son is now married and has two children.</p><h3><strong>James Harbaugh</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> September 4, 1996</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 27 Years Old</li></ul><p>The second child between Jim and Miah Harbaugh is James Harbaugh who is also a Michigan graduate. He is a theatre major graduate of the University of Michigan where he got a BFA in directing.</p><p>Named after his father, James was born on September 4, 1996, the same year his parents got married. He has not shown any interest in the family sports tradition and prefers the arts. He likes the outdoors and is often seen enjoying the beautiful sights of nature in its purest form.</p><p>He is also openly gay and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>his account of the day he came out</a> to his dad is nothing but touching as the older Harbaugh was very encouraging, telling his son that everything will be fine. His fears of having to face his father with the news went down the drains as he was shown nothing but love.</p><h3><strong>Grace Harbaugh</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 27th June 2000</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 23 years old</li></ul><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy 15th Birthday to beloved daughter Grace Harbaugh! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/jl92FwLSTd</a></p><p>— Coach Harbaugh (@CoachJim4UM) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">June 27, 2015</a></p><p>Born on 27th June 2000, Grace Harbaugh is currently 23 years old. She was born four years after her parents Jim Harbaugh and Miah Harbaugh got married. Grace is the third and last child of Jim Harbaugh and his first wife but she prefers to stay away from the spotlight. Even her Instagram account is private.</p><p>Coming from a lone line of sportsmen, Grace followed suit but she chose water polo instead. She <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>played the sport</a> at Coronado High School where she graduated in 2019. She also got a history of art major at the University of Michigan.</p><p>Grace began playing water polo at the age of fourteen and also loves to swim. She has won many medals in the sport and her father is always proud of her achievements.</p><h3><strong>Addison Harbaugh</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/1c8c25a582b65100ae0a5738e8daa9b8.jpg><p>Addison Harbaugh is one of Jim Harbaugh’s two daughters with his second wife Sarah. She is believed to be the first child born between the couple but her date of birth is unknown. Being the daughter of Jim Harbaugh is her only claim to fame and so far, she has not shown any sign of joining the family sports tradition.</p><h3><strong>Katherine Harbaugh</strong></h3><p>Like her sister Addison, nothing is known about Katherine Harbaugh, including her date of birth. However, it is clear that she is the daughter of Jim and Sarah Harbaugh. Katherine and her sister came first in the family after their parents got married.</p><p>They have chosen to live a life away from the spotlight and aside from a few public appearances with their parents, the girls are not usually found in public.</p><h3><strong>Jack Harbaugh</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong>&nbsp;2012</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 11 years old</li></ul><p>Born in 2012, Jack is the first son of Jim Harbaugh and his second wife Sarah Feuerborn Harbaugh but he is the third son of the American football coach. Aside from his year of birth, not much has been shared about Jack Harbaugh but he is apparently still in school. Jack is named after his grandfather who also played American football and retired as a coach.</p><p>Now 11 years old, the little lad is yet to carve a career path for himself but he has shown interest in his father’s career. He is often seen with the American football coach and often attends his games.</p><h3><strong>Jim Harbaugh’s Youngest Child is John Harbaugh, is 6 Years Old</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 2017</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 6 years old</li></ul><p>The only information about his birth available in the public space is that Jack Harbaugh was born in 2017. This makes him 6 years old at this time. The young lad is named after his uncle John William Harbaugh, the head coach of the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL) who was born on September 23, 1962.</p><p>Being surrounded by sportsmen who are stars in the American football arena, it won’t come as a surprise if John grows up to join the trend. For now, he is just busy being a kid.</p><h2><strong>Does Jim Harbaugh Have Twin Children?</strong></h2><p>There are several speculations suggesting that Jim has twins in his home, but this is not true. All his seven children were born separately by their moms. Jim Harbaugh’s children were born in separate years, and none came as twins.</p><p>Another twin rumor that has followed Jim is that he and his brother John are twins, but this is also not true. In fact, John Harbaugh is the older brother of Jim Harbough. While John was born on 23rd September 1962, Jim was born on 23rd December 1963. Due to the closeness of their birth, people tend to think they are twins, but they are not.</p><p>Both Harbaugh brothers are doing well in their careers as football coaches. Like Jim, John is also an American football coach, and he is currently serving as the head coach of the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). Since he joined the Raven in 2008, John has led the team to 145 wins.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3><strong>How Many Kids Does Jim Harbaugh Have?</strong></h3><p>Jim Harbaugh has seven children, namely Jay Harbaugh (born June 14, 1989), James Harbaugh (born September 4, 1996), Grace Harbaugh (born June 27, 2000), Addison Harbaugh, Katherine Harbaugh, Jack Harbaugh (born 2012), and John Harbaugh (born 2017).</p><h3><strong>Is Jim Harbaugh Currently Married?</strong></h3><p>Jim Harbaugh is presently married to Sarah Feuerborn Harbaugh.
