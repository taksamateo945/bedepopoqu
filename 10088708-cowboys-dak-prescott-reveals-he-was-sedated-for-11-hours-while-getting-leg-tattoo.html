When I saw Mike the next day and my leg was big, he [said] 'What [happened to you]?'"</p><p>Owner Jerry Jones didn't find out about it until he was informed by the <i>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</i>. When asked about Prescott's decision, Jones said: "I certainly didn't know he was under for 10 hours. Just so you're clear, I had no idea about tattoos. I better get up to date on it. I had no idea that required that kind of sedation of any tattoo. It further explains to me why I don't have a tattoo."</p><p>The 30-year-old Prescott signed a four-year, $160 million contract extension with the Cowboys in 2021 and is signed through at least the 2024 season.</p><p>Over seven NFL seasons, the 2016 fourth-round pick out of Mississippi State is a two-time Pro Bowler and was the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.</p><p>He also owns a career record of 61-36 during the regular season and has thrown for 24,943 yards, 166 touchdowns and 65 interceptions.</p><p>Last season, Dallas reached the playoffs as a wild-card team, and in 12 games, Prescott threw for 2,860 yards, 23 touchdowns and a league-high 15 interceptions.</p><p>Prescott will look to cut down on the turnovers in 2023, but the Cowboys' offense should remain explosive regardless with Lamb and Pollard as his top weapons.</p><p>Dak and the Cowboys will get their 2023 season underway on Sunday night when they face the NFC East rival New York Giants on the road.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaG2EcYSMnKawmp%2BuwG6wwKRkqaqVqLCwwNNmqZ6ulZa5tHnHnmSwmaNiwKawwK2cnWWWpL9ufZBmn6itoqh6uLTIpZxmn5Wpwaq6xmajnp9dqa61wM6o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-thai-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Thai Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</span></a>
