She is probably best known for her role in Pretty Little Liars, where she portrayed&nbsp;Emily Fields, the captain of the swimming team and lesbian, which is coming out during season 1.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Shay Mitchell and Her Thinking About Relationship</h3><p>As mentioned before, the actress’s leading role was a lesbian teenager and, later on, a young woman. However, the part can be “labeled” your real life even after you not playing a role.</p><p>Many people questioned her about her sexual orientation – is she gay or straight? So in one interview with Maxim magazine, she responded: “Look, Emily doesn’t label herself, and I don’t label myself either. I fall in love with the spirit of somebody. Love is love, and that’s something that I’ll keep saying.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shay Mitchell and Her Boyfriend Matte Babel</h2><p><strong>Matte Babel</strong>&nbsp;is from Toronto, Canada, the same as his&nbsp;partner <strong>Shay Mitchell</strong>. He is an actor and journalist best known for his roles in Degrassi: The Next Generation, for TV series Post Malone’s Celebrity World Pong League, Entertainment Tonight Canada, and several more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Shay-Mitchell-and-Matte-Babel.jpg><p>Also, he is involved with a group DreamCrew, which manages Drake’s career and business portfolio. In one interview, he revealed that they had known each other for a long time:</p><p>“We’ve known each other for nine years. We met each other in Toronto. Like Drake and all of them, it’s a Toronto crew. We’re awesome friends.”</p><p>Officially the couple&nbsp;<strong>started dating in 2017</strong>, but they keep their relationship private. However, Shay is very open about her luxurious life on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. Also, she sometimes shares their&nbsp;<strong>daughter</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Babel’s&nbsp;photo but only talks a little about them to the press.</p><p>In 2019 the couple became parents to their&nbsp;<strong>daughter Atlas Noa</strong>. The daughter was very welcomed because, just a year ago, in 2018, Mitchell had a miscarriage. She miscarried their first baby at 14 weeks. Mitchell felt devastated. That’s why she opened up about it during&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her Youtube</a>&nbsp;series&nbsp;Almost Ready&nbsp;when they expected their second child.</p><p>She said about her sad experience: “When it happened, I was just completely blindsided by it,” she emotionally said. “I still have those photos on my phone. I still have all the doctor visit (videos), and it’s weird because I haven’t looked at them, but it’s not like I forgot about that happening.”.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Shay Mitchell opened about the marriage</h3><p><strong>Shay Mitchell and her boyfriend Matte babel</strong> are not rushing into marriage.</p><p>She opened up to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ELLE magazine</a>: “I don’t know if I’ve done anything in order,” she said. “I didn’t get&nbsp;<strong>married</strong>&nbsp;before a child. I had a child but didn’t get married. I don’t know if that’s in the cards for us. I think we both agree; maybe it’s just me.”</p><p>She continued, “There’s no pressure here. I love it. I love that we come home, and every day I’m like, ‘I choose you, and you choose me.’ It keeps us on our toes. I’m like, ‘Hey, I can walk out. I don’t need to go through a lawyer; I can walk out.’ And the same with him. It keeps it sexy.”</p><p>Mitchell shares her happiness with her social media followers and her love for a partner and daughter. She is pretty sure that she does not need a ring to prove their feelings to each other, and the true statement about their love is their daughter&nbsp;Atlas Noa. Even without a&nbsp;<strong>husband’s and wife’s</strong>&nbsp;status, they show each other love and support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibopqytbuNnKamZ6edvG610maqoZmpYrqqwMKhnKWkXZe8urLRopynnF2ewG6%2Fx55kppmip7amsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reginae-carter-is-proud-of-her-queen-mom-toya-johnson-after-seeing-her-jaw-dropping-commercial-watch-it-here-445378.html><span>←</span><span>Reginae Carter Is Proud Of Her Queen Mom, Toya Johnson After Seeing Her Jaw-Dropping Commercial</span></a>
