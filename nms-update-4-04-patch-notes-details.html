invalid price for the ship.</li><li>Fixed a number of visual issues with inventory slot unlocking.</li><li>Fixed a number of issues that caused Journey Milestone guidance missions to end too early.</li><li>Addressed a bug that could prevent bases from correctly uploading.</li><li>The visual quality of stars has been improved when using TAA and FSR 2.0.</li><li>Addressed a bug that
