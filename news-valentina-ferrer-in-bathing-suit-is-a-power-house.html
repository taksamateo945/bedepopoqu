Since then, she has started a modeling career, and has walked in both Miami and New York Fashion Week. She has also started a TV career, notably appearing in </span><i><span>Betty en NY.</span></i><span> Ferrer has a strong following on Instagram as well. In a recent video, she is seen doing crunches in a handstand. She wore a red bathing suit, her figure on display. How does she stay so fit? Read on to see 5 ways Valentina Ferrer stays in shape and the photos that prove they work—and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><p><span>Ferrer makes sure to take supplements. She even has her own line of supplements, called Kapowder. One thing Ferrer likes to do is take probiotics."[Taking] probiotics is something vital for me every day to avoid gastritis and [for] intestinal care," she tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>People</span></a><span>. "Everything is natural. I have also used them during pregnancy." </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Cleveland Clinic</span></a><span> states that probiotics are very beneficial. "Probiotics are made of good live bacteria and/or yeasts that naturally live in your body. You constantly have both good and bad bacteria in your body. When you get an infection, there's more bad bacteria, knocking your system out of balance. Good bacteria helps eliminate extra bad bacteria, returning the balance. Probiotic-supplements are a way to add good bacteria to your body."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/GettyImages-1475681061.jpg><p><span>Another thing Ferrer makes sure to get enough of is electrolytes. She opened up about this to People. "Around here we have electrolytes. For people who travel a lot, train too much, we always need electrolytes, which are fundamental and very important, to stay hydrated." </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Cleveland Clinic</span></a><span> states, "The right amount of electrolytes in your body is needed for optimal health and physical performance. If you lose a significant amount of these minerals (either by intense exercise, sweating, vomiting or diarrhea), you're going to experience dehydration and feel pretty lousy. You might also experience muscle cramping and spasms."</span></p><p><span>After having her first child, Ferrer opened up about it to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Hola</span></a><span>. In it, she was asked about her post-baby training. "I tell you a word: Pilates," she answers. "In Pilates you learn to know your body and you take the strength where you need it. You don't force yourself too much, not even the other way." </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Better Health</span></a><span> states that Pilates has a lot of benefits. </span><span>"Pilates promotes mobility and strength of all the major muscle groups in the body in a balanced fashion, whilst also having a key focus on the deep core muscles. It improves posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/GettyImages-1469142625.jpg><p><span>Ferrer talked to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Glamour </span></a><span>about her beauty secrets. She says that beauty isn't about what she looks like on the outside. Rather, she focuses on her inner beauty and self-confidence. "Beauty is how you feel inside," she says. "And that is reflected through your eyes. Happiness is beauty."</span></p><p><span>As you can see from her recent post, Ferrer makes sure to do ab workouts. Having a strong core is important. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Mayo Clinic</span></a><span> states, "Your core is the central part of your body. It includes your pelvis, lower back, hips and stomach. The stomach muscles sometimes are called abs. Core exercises train the muscles in your core to work in harmony. This leads to better balance and steadiness, also called stability. Stability is important whether you're on the playing field or doing regular activities. In fact, most sports and other physical activities depend on stable core muscles."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkr5mcmru1tc2aZJ%2Bdoqeys3nIp2SbmaSdtq%2BzjKysoqxdnsBurYypprCdomK1sMHSnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./william-boeing-18811001-html.html><span>←</span><span>William Boeing (Entrepreneur) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
