Here is a reminder of some of his best moments from this campaign:</span></p><p><span class=s1>The Premier League has always looked tailored for the player, too. Not only does he have the big personality to cope in such a high-pressure environment, but his physicality would enable him to thrive up front. His supreme technical skill surpasses that of many forwards in the division.</span></p><p><span class=s1>A new challenge may also keep Ibrahimovic motivated and performing to an elite level a little longer yet.</span></p><p><span class=s1>Throughout his career, he’s moved between clubs on a regular basis, and the goals have flowed in the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and France. If he were to up sticks for England, there’s little to suggest that trend would end.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9pZ2qCdHnZpZitmZ5itqO%2BwKGgpqemnrBuwNGapayelad6s8HMqKyrq12hrrWx0q1kp52nqHq0vMScrKWZpJ68r3nOp2Spq5dis7C%2B1pqpnQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./piece-of-cake-hyph-html.html><span>←</span><span>Piece of cake!: Hyph.</span></a>
