Police identified Fiston Ngoy, of Philadelphia, through surveillance footage that caught him sexually assaulting a woman Wednesday night aboard a Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) train towards the town of Upper Darby.
Upper Darby Police Superintendent Timothy Bernhardt said that while there were other people on the train, it was ultimately a SEPTA employee who made the call to 911, which allowed officers to arrest Ngoy on the spot."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
