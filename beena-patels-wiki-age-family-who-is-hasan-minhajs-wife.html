Sometime during her youth, she decided to pursue a career in the medical field, so after matriculating from high school, she enrolled at the University of California, Davis to compete an undergraduate degree, with a major in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior. The public university has the third highest enrollment in the entire UC system, and dates its history back to 1909. It is considered a public ivy, having quality education rivaling that of the prestigious Ivy League schools.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hasan-Minhaj-and-Beena-Minhaj-1024x643.jpg></p><p>The school has had many notable alumni, with many becoming a part of prestigious groups such as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Some of their graduates have gone on to win awards such as the Pulitzer Prize, Nobel Peace Prize, and Blue Planet Prize. UC Davis started out initially as a campus focused on agriculture though has later expanded. They are now also known for their programs in medicine, law, business, and many others. They also have an athletic team which competes as a part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in Division I.</p><h2><span id=Further_Studies_and_Career>Further Studies and Career</span></h2><p>Following the completion of Patel’s undergraduate studies, she continued her education in UC Davis, this time in the School of Medicine to take up a Master’s degree in Public Health. After completing her master’s degree, she then enrolled in another UC campus, this time in Los Angeles (UCLA), taking up a Doctor of Public Health degree. It is the fourth oldest in the UC 10 campus system, offering numerous degrees and having a student population at around 45,000. They are one of the most popular universities in the US in terms of applications. Prior to her graduation, she was given a <a rel=nofollow href=#>Milton and Ruth Roemer Prize</a>.</p><p>Carrying her doctorate degree, worked for several companies, beginning with the Sacramento-based company Retinal Consultants, where she worked as a clinical research co-ordinator. As a part of her position, she often dealt with other known pharmaceutical companies, including Avastin and Lucentis. Her next career move occured in 2008, when she became a clinical operations analyst for Cave Consulting Group. The position also had her working with organizations focused on health care, including the National Quality Forum (NQF).</p><h2><span id=Recent_Positions_and_Public_Appearances>Recent Positions and Public Appearances</span></h2><p>Beena stayed with Cave Consulting Group for two years, and then joined the Los Angeles-based organization called UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. While working with them, she also became the program director for the Los Angeles-based Homeless Patient Aligned Care Team which is a part of the Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. She held these positions for the next three years, before becoming a practice management consultant for the company MedAmerica. She was later promoted to transformation consultant, and has been in that position since 2017.</p><p>Aside from her regular work, she is not averse to appearing in public alongside her husband, often joining him for big events to support him. In 2016 the couple visited the White House, where they had a pictorial, after meeting with President Barack Obama who invited them. The following year, the couple appeared together during the 76th Annual Peabody Awards where they flaunted their attire on the red carpet. The two also participated during the White House Correspondents Dinner hosted by her husband during Donald Trump’s presidency. One of her most recent public appearances was during the “70th Primetime Emmy Awards”, where she was spotted alongside her husband at the event held in Los Angeles</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>Patel met Minhaj while both of them were students at UC Davis, and he admitted to being attracted to her the moment they met. They began dating, and stayed together for many years before marrying in 2015. They only moved in together after their marriage, as both of them respected their family’s traditions and Indian culture. They had a child in 2018 ,though outside of their public appearances, they like to keep a low profile. Hasan does his best not to mention any intimate details about their marriage and family life. Most of what has been revealed to the public are just posts shown on her husband’s Instagram page. She also has a few social media accounts, but all of them are private.</p><p>They recently decided to move from Los Angeles to New York City, buying an apartment there which she decorated. Due to his <a rel=nofollow href=#>work</a> as a stand-up comedian, he has jokingly discussed his married life through his act, though like many routines, a lot of it is exaggerated for comedic effect. During their free time, they like to participate in charity , and they use their popularity to help promote advocacies they are involved in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCpnZSerm%2B70aBmm52Vo65uvMCtnKWrXay2rLWMmp6eZZaWuqq42GauoaddnsButMCsmKdlnZ67qa3JrGSwoZaafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./148367-5-action-packed-videos-sa-born-woman-jenny-ayumi-playing-wednesdays-stunt-double-netflix-series.html><span>←</span><span>5 Action-Packed Videos of the SA-born Woman Jenny Ayumi Playing Wednesday's Stunt Double in New Netf</span></a>
