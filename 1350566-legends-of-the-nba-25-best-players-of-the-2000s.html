Jermaine O'Neal is a player who doesn't get as much credit as he deserves. In the 2000s, O'Neal averaged 16.5 points, 8.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game for the Indiana Pacers.
While those numbers aren't as good as some other superstars who made this list, they are still impressive in their own right.
O'Neal's major issue was that he continually focused on his perimeter game, rather than his interior post game, which resulted in his 46 percent shooting percentage for the decade."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Jermaine O'Neal, C, Indiana Pacers</strong>: 2000-2009 (10 Seasons)&nbsp;</p><p>Jermaine O'Neal is a player who doesn't get as much credit as he deserves. In the 2000s, O'Neal averaged 16.5 points, 8.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game for the Indiana Pacers.</p><p>While those numbers aren't as good as some other superstars who made this list, they are still impressive in their own right.</p><p>O'Neal's major issue was that he continually focused on his perimeter game, rather than his interior post game, which resulted in his 46 percent shooting percentage for the decade. That is relatively low for the 6'11" power forward/center. O'Neal was as close as you can come to making the list, but his low shooting percentage kept him off.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>28. Ben Wallace, C, Detroit Pistons:</strong>&nbsp;2000-2009 (10 Seasons)</p><p>Ben Wallace was a poor-man's Dennis Rodman during the 2000s. He only performed on an elite level on the defensive side of the ball and on the glass, and he helped his team win an NBA title.</p><p>Wallace averaged 11.2 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game for the Pistons in the 2000s, and he was an absolute monster on the defensive side of the ball. From shutting down <a href=#>Shaquille O'Neal</a> to hanging with Tim Duncan, Wallace owned the paint during the 2000s.</p><p>If he was more of a force on the offensive side of the ball, he could have squeaked his way onto this list.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>27. Gilbert Arenas, SG, Golden State Warriors: </strong>2002-2009 (Eight Seasons)</p><p>If you want a player who is all about offensive production, then Gilbert Arenas is your man. In the 2000s, Arenas averaged 22.8 points per game on 42.7 percent shooting from the field and 35.8 percent from beyond the arc.</p><p>Arenas also kept his teammates involved at an impressive level, averaging 5.5 assists per game in the decade. If he put more time in on the defensive side of the ball, he could have been a more complete player and had a more productive NBA career.</p><p>Instead, he let his off-the-court issues impact his career (via the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>), and that's why he didn't make the cut for the top 25 players of the 2000s.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>26. Shawn Marion, SF, Phoenix Suns:&nbsp;</strong>2000-2009 (10 Seasons)&nbsp;</p><p>Shawn Marion has been a journeyman in the NBA, playing for four teams over the span of his 13-year career. But his most productive days came in the 2000s when he was playing with the Phoenix Suns.</p><p>From being one-tenth of a rebound per game away from averaging a double-double over the decade to shooting 48.1 percent from the field, Marion was a force to be reckoned with on the offensive side of the ball.</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn't help the Suns get to the NBA Finals. Because of that, he's barely kept off this list.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGxtYGqDd3nLnp6eppSoerCyjK2fnmWel65ufpRmmZ6rpGK9ra3YnqmsZZ%2BberW0xGZpaWhgqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./irish-spring-soap-rat-repellent.html><span>←</span><span>DIY Expert Says Irish Spring Soap Will Keep Rats Away for Good Best Life</span></a>
