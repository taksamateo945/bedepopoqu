According to ESPN Stats & Info, his touchdown-to-interception ratio was double Tony Romo's, who sat second place in the category:</p>ESPN Stats & Info <span class=acct>@ESPNStatsInfo</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Aaron Rodgers wins the MVP. His TD-Int ratio this season was twice as good the next-closest player http://t.co/N4YoZBnTlK</p><p>Some wondered whether J.J. Watt would be the first defensive player to be MVP since Lawrence Taylor in 1986. While the Houston Texans defensive tackle finished second to Rodgers, he was still 18 first-place votes behind.</p><p>Sports Illustrated's Aaron Nagler provided a full breakdown of the voting:</p>Aaron Nagler <span class=acct>@AaronNagler</span><p lang=fr dir=ltr>Rodgers: 31 votes. Watt: 13 votes Murray: 2 votes Romo: 2 votes Brady: 1 vote Wagner: 1 vote Wagner?

Watt got 13 MVP votes. First time this century a defensive player got more than three MVP votes.</p><p>While Watt made a strong case, few will offer much argument as to Rodgers' credentials.</p><p>That Rodgers managed to win the MVP Award but miss out on Offensive Player of the Year—which instead <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">went</a> to DeMarco Murray, per the NFL—is something that <span>Fox Sports' Mike&nbsp;</span>Garafolo<span>&nbsp;found a bit odd</span>:</p>Mike Garafolo <span class=acct>@MikeGarafolo</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Aaron Rodgers named the MVP but not offensive player of the year. Alrighty.</p><p>Even more puzzling was the lone vote for Seattle Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner. Bleacher Report's Mike Freeman was one of many questioning that choice:</p>mike freeman <span class=acct>@mikefreemanNFL</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who was it that voted for Bobby Wagner for MVP? Seriously, who was that?</p><p>In the end, it's all about who won, though.</p><p>Rodgers' numbers speak for themselves, and when you combine them with the Packers' success on the field, he was an easy choice for MVP.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaWxsaWqGdHnNn6NmpaalenN8kG1kam1drLavusSrZK%2BnpJ67qHnRnqqupKSoeqK6w2arsKGkqbKzedGemJysmaS7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jose-luis-garcia-perez.html><span>←</span><span>Jose Luis Garcia Perez Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
