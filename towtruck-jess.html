She started with her TikTok account later on.</p><p>On her Tiktok profile, one of the most popular uploads is a video that is set to Randy Newman‘s song You’ve Got a Friend in Me. Moreover, her TikTok videos are a mix of comedy, lip-sync singing to sound bites and pop songs, driving her tow truck, micro-vlogging, and preaching about her religion.
