They are eventually compelled to leave and face the approaching catastrophe outside.</p><p>Fans might not anticipate a film about the end of the world to be so humorous, yet it came in second place to Man of Steel on its opening weekend. Even though the Motion Picture Association of America gave it a R rating, film did well at the box office. Against a $36 million budget, it brought in $126 million globally.</p><h3><span id=Top_Five_2014_8211_86>Top Five (2014) – 86%</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Kevin-Hart-in-Top-Five.jpg alt="kevin hart taraji p henson movies,the bank heist,kevin hart and taraji p henson,the bank heist movie,kevin hart height,michael ealy,bank heist,adam sandler movies,me time,funny movies with kevin hart,movies with kevin hart and the rock,kevin hart movies netflix,kevin hart movies comedy,kevin hart what now,kevin hart best movies,kevin hart new movies,kevin hart new movie netflix,kevin hart comedy specials,kevin hart: what now?,kevin hart movies and tv shows,kevin hart movies imdb,kevin hart movies on netflix,kevin hart movies 2022,kevin hart movies list,kevin hart movies 2021,kevin hart movies 2020,kevin hart movies on hulu,kevin hart movies on netflix 2022,kevin hart movies on netflix 2021,the rock and kevin hart movies,best kevin hart movies,new kevin hart movies,latest kevin hart movies,recent kevin hart movies,ice cube and kevin hart movies,upcoming kevin hart movies,mark wahlberg kevin hart movies" width=750 height=375 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>accessible via Paramount+<br>The humorous comedy Top Five was written, directed, and starred by Chris Rock. Rock plays a struggling comedian who spends the day with a reporter (Rosario Dawson) as he gets ready for the debut of a new movie and his much publicised wedding. In the film, Hart plays Rock’s agent.</p><p>According to critics, this was the film that Rock was destined to create and a high point in his filmography. Along with several entertaining cameos from people like <a href=#>Adam Sandler</a>, Cedric the Entertainer, and Jerry <a href=#>Seinfeld</a>, it is jam-packed with the kind of witty and insightful humour that can be found in Rock’s stand-up.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="kevin hart taraji p henson movies,the bank heist,kevin hart and taraji p henson,the bank heist movie,kevin hart height,michael ealy,bank heist,adam sandler movies,me time,funny movies with kevin hart,movies with kevin hart and the rock,kevin hart movies netflix,kevin hart movies comedy,kevin hart what now,kevin hart best movies,kevin hart new movies,kevin hart new movie netflix,kevin hart comedy specials,kevin hart: what now?,kevin hart movies and tv shows,kevin hart movies imdb,kevin hart movies on netflix,kevin hart movies 2022,kevin hart movies list,kevin hart movies 2021,kevin hart movies 2020,kevin hart movies on hulu,kevin hart movies on netflix 2022,kevin hart movies on netflix 2021,the rock and kevin hart movies,best kevin hart movies,new kevin hart movies,latest kevin hart movies,recent kevin hart movies,ice cube and kevin hart movies,upcoming kevin hart movies,mark wahlberg kevin hart movies" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
