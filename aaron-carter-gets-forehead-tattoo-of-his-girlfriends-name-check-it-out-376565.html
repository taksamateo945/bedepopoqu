Had so much fun hanging out with the guy and bringing back his signature bright blonde.’</p><p>Hopefully, Aaron and Melanie will last for a long time and he will never regret the name tattoo!</p><p>This is not the only big step the singer took, however!</p><p>As you may be aware, after the tattoo session, the pair went diamond rings shopping and sure enough, a clip was shared on social media in which Melanie tries on a huge engagement diamond at a jeweler’s.</p><p>Aaron can be heard asking about the price of the first diamond ring and the answer which is ‘$80k’ does not seem to faze him.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B9cm75GlKKs/</p><p>As shown on the price tag, it actually costs a total of $80,800!</p><p>The name tattoo comes half a year after he got his first face ink back in September!</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>At the time, fans were not happy at all to see it and it’s safe to say that most of them won’t be gushing over his romantic gesture either.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRlr%2BwuoycmKuslad6qLHTrGSfp6Kataatw2armqykpLxuu8Vmn6KrXZy2s7jFq6CeppSoeq%2BtzJ5knKCVmLhutdNmpq6sXWiEd4GVbmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jim-carrey-dumb-and-dumber.html><span>←</span><span>Jim Carrey Originally Wanted Nicolas Cage As His Dumb And Dumber Partner, But Cage Chose Leaving</span></a>
