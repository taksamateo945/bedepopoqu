Yubo is even seen guiding a large calligraphy brush with ease. The video has garnered over 780,000 views and 4,600 likes since this writing.</span></p><p><span>According to Yubo’s mother, on some occasions the 3-year-old will wake up in the middle of the night to practice his calligraphy before heading back to bed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“He once got up at midnight to use the bathroom and then decided to practice calligraphy,” Miao recalled. “He then went directly to pick up the brush and began writing, and told us that he would go to sleep after finishing writing a character.”</span></p><p><span>Yubo’s mother explained that her son first learned to hold a calligraphy brush when he was a year old, and “can now write hundred of Chinese characters.” Rather than pressuring the 3-year-old to practice calligraphy, Miao stated that she and her husband allow Yubo to practice on his own accord.</span></p><p><span>Weibo users were impressed by the boys’ skills and praised their passion for calligraphy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“My family could only count to 10 when they were three years old,” one user wrote.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“This little boy is really the reincarnation of a calligrapher,” another user commented.</span></p><p><span>Featured Image via&nbsp;</span><span>Weibo</span></p><h3>Support our Journalism with a Contribution</h3><p>Many people might not know this, but despite our large and loyal following which we are immensely grateful for, NextShark is still a small bootstrapped startup that runs on no outside funding or loans.</p><p>Everything you see today is built on the backs of warriors who have sacrificed opportunities to help give Asians all over the world a bigger voice.</p><p>However, we still face many trials and tribulations in our industry, from figuring out the most sustainable business model for independent media companies to facing the current COVID-19 pandemic decimating advertising revenues across the board.</p><p>We hope you consider making a contribution so we can continue to provide you with quality content that informs, educates and inspires the Asian community.<br><span class=donate_way><strong>Even a $1 contribution goes a long way.</strong></span> Thank you for everyone’s support.
