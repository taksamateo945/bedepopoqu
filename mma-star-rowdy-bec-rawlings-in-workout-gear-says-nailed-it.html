<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>MMA Star Rowdy Bec Rawlings In Workout Gear Says Nailed It</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>MMA star "Rowdy" Bec Rawlings is showing off her new workout gear in a social media selfie.&nbsp; Rawlings, 35, shared a video of herself posing in front of a mirror wearing jogging pants and a pink tank top, her strong, toned fighter's physique on display. The voiceover she chose for her video made fun of how she doesn't look like the typical "girly girl". "Nailed it üíÖüèª," she humorously captioned the post. Here's how the Australian fighter stays strong, fit, and focused.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Rawlings' bare knuckle style gives her an advantage in the ring. "I grew up pretty rough," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she told </span><i><span>Combat Press</span></i></a><span>. "I love to fight, and when they approached me, I didn't hesitate to say yes. I'm excited about being able to showcase my boxing skills without the threat of a takedown or kicks, that's for sure. No gloves isn't too far off from MMA gloves, so I've adapted well compared to a pro boxer that's always boxed in [big] gloves."</span></p><p><span>Rawlings goes running in the morning and trains for up to four hours a day, which includes two hours of boxing. "I love the adrenaline of it. I love the rawness of the sport," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she told </span><i><span>CNN</span></i></a><span>. "It's not just the physicality, it's not just the athleticism, it's your mentality and your heart to fight and keep going. I'm forever tested no matter how my fight goes. I learn something new about myself and I think that's what keeps me coming back for more and it's the same with training."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-1202641958.jpg><p><span>Rawlings was thrilled to move from strawweight to flyweight. "Normally I'm very focused and concentrating on my diet and trying to get through training camp basically on zero calories," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she told </span><i><span>UFC Espanol</span></i></a><span>. "Whereas this camp I've eaten well. I still eat clean and I still track everything I'm doing just because I'm very obsessive with my fight camps and take everything very seriously. But I've been able to focus a hundred percent on fighting. I felt amazing this camp. It's crazy."</span></p><p><span>Rawlings hopes her story will encourage other women to try combat sports. "It was originally a male-dominated industry, but women are gaining more traction now within combat sports," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she told </span><i><span>Providence</span></i></a><span>. "I helped break down the barrier and stigma that women can't fight and that we are too fragile to compete in combat sports. I also shared with Fighters Against Child Abuse Australia a horrible and embarrassing truth about my personal life: how I walked away from an abusive relationship while raising my two sons. I hope sharing my story helps others and creates awareness that even people like myself can still fall victim to domestic violence."</span></p><p><span>Rawlings is careful to protect her mental as well as physical help. "We can know our worth, and we can fight for it," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she told </span><i><span>Providence</span></i></a><span>. "Because of my experiences, I have to learn how to love and learn how to be loved again. I don't know if I'll ever be the same, but I will be okay, I'll fight another day. I remind myself each day to be kind to myself. The biggest turning point for me with my mental health was learning to love myself, and reminding myself that I'm worthy of good things, good people, and success."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK65wGaqrZmiYr%2Bww8OyZJudk2K%2FosPLoqWgq12eu27DzquiqK2kYrSmrdFmqpqxo2K7orXLnptmoaRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cindy-williams-on-finding-happiness-see-the-glass-as-half-full-no-matter-what-57504.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Cindy Williams on Finding Happiness: See the Glass as Half Full No Matter What!</span></a>
