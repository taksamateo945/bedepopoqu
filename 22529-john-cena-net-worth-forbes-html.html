The income from these deals has contributed to his current net worth. Here is a look at the deals.</p><h4>Wonderful Pistachios</h4><p class=align-left>In 2016, Cena landed an advertising deal with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Wonderful Pistachios</a>. He appeared in the brand's commercials as a health-conscious, snarky elephant known as Ernie.

As a result of the deal, John Cena's face appeared on 5 million Fruity Pebbles boxes.</p><h4>Gillette</h4><p class=align-left>In 2008, Gillette announced that it had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">signed a deal</a> with Cena to promote its line of premium blades, shaving preparations, and personal care items. The WWE star was featured in several commercials and public appearances at the company's marketing events.</p><h4>Hefty</h4><p class=align-left>Cena signed a multi-million-dollar deal with Hefty, the renowned <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">garbage bag manufacturer</a>.

In addition, he owns two magnificent houses. Here are these properties in detail.</p><h4>House in Tampa, Florida</h4><p class=align-left>John moved out of his parents' home in West Newbury, Massachusetts, a while after becoming a professional wrestler.

The property was even featured in a few episodes of <i>Total Bellas.</i> The $3.4-million mansion is located in the Mission Hills area of San Diego. <a href=#>The mansion</a> features a massive garage, ivy-themed kitchen, and two swimming pools.</p><ul><li><strong>1st Generation Ford GT:</strong> This car became world-famous for its performances on the racetrack. It became one of the few Ford models that could compete with supercars from other companies such as Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Aston Martin.</li><li><strong>2006 Dodge Viper:</strong> <a href=#>This vehicle</a> is powered by a massive 8.3-litre naturally aspirated V10 engine capable of outputting 500HP. Cena has been pictured driving the Viper occasionally.</li><li><strong>2nd Generation Ford GT: </strong>While the original Ford GT was rare, the second generation was even harder to come by. When Ford began manufacturing it, potential buyers had to send applications to purchase the car. The company then handpicked the eventual buyers from the list of applicants, and luckily, Cena was among them.</li><li><strong>C6 Corvette ZR1: </strong>This was the first Corvette to move away from a naturally aspirated engine to a supercharged one. The vehicle is powered by a 638HP engine capable of accelerating it to a mind-blowing 205mph (about 330kph).</li><li><strong>Corvette InCENArator:</strong> This vehicle has often been described as 'the worst custom car ever built.' Still, looks are subjective, and what works for one might not work for another. This customized vehicle was based on a regular Corvette. The Park Brothers Concepts did its custom bodywork.</li><li><strong>Lamborghini Gallardo:</strong> The Gallardo is powered by a 5204cc 10-cylinder engine. At the time of its launch, it was among the best-looking sports cars in the world. While better, faster, and more powerful models have since come along, this Lambo is still a joy to look at.</li><li><strong>Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren Roadster:</strong> This vehicle was made when Mercedes owned a 40% stake in McLaren. The roadster features a long hood covering a 600HP V8 engine powering the car via the rear wheels.</li><li><strong>Plymouth Road Runner Superbird: </strong>This was the first 'supercar' to participate in NASCAR competitions. At the time, NASCAR did not allow vehicles into the competition unless they were stock cars that could be found in a regular showroom. Plymouth created the Road Runner Superbird to be a stock vehicle, meaning anyone could walk into a showroom and purchase one.</li></ul><h3>Who is the richest wrestler?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/81b47a0693db9e1a.jpg><p class=align-left>Vince McMahon is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">world's richest wrestler</a>, with a net worth of $1.6 Billion.
