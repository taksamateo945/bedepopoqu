The biggest stars in Hollywood, fashion, and music conquered the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday, May 4, and then let loose (often in different outfits) at a wild Met Gala Afterparty at the Boom Boom Room in New York City’s downtown Meatpacking District. <strong>Us Weekly</strong> was on the scene at the Top of the Standard — <a href=#>site of the infamous Solange, Beyonce, and Jay Z elevator scuffle last year</a> — getting a very close-up look at the star-studded soirée. <a href=#>Click here to see more photos from the Met Gala afterparties!</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Celebrating the 2015 Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute Gala, the swanky affair included appearances by <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio, Bradley Cooper, P Diddy, Selena Gomez, Jessica Alba</strong>, and <strong>Kendall</strong> and <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong>. While he didn’t attend the gala, <strong>John Mayer</strong> turned up at the afterparty, where he met his on-again, off-again girlfriend <strong>Katy Perry</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The two musicians have long remained coy about the status of their ever-changing relationship, but seem to be back on in a big way. Perry, 30, kicked off the night with designer <strong>Jeremy Scott</strong>, the man behind her playful Moschino Met Gala dress. She did an outfit swap for the party, changing into a blonde wig and ditching her voluminous gown for a jacket and skirt.&nbsp;</p><p>After getting in some quality time with her fashion designer pal, Perry spent much of her evening canoodling with Mayer, 37. The evidently on-again lovebirds stood very close to one another at the Boom Boom Room, leaning in for many passionate kisses and holding hands as they drank champagne and chatted with other famous attendees.&nbsp;</p><p>The affectionate twosome ducked into a back section with pals <strong>Allison Williams</strong>, <strong>Robert Pattinson</strong> and his fiancée <strong>FKA twigs</strong>, and a few others. A longtime Pattinson confidante, Perry bonded with the future Mrs. Pattinson, laughing and hugging the British singer, while Mayer talked shop with the Twilight actor before the men stepped outside together for a smoke.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Later, the group was joined by Oscar winner <strong>Eddie Redmayne</strong>. The celebrated star said a quick hello to the group, after stunning at the Met Gala with his new wife <strong>Hannah Bagshawe</strong> on his arm.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a date night as well for fun-loving couple <strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong> and <strong>John Legend</strong>, who showed up at the Standard a little after midnight and found a spot in a booth by the dance floor. They weren’t alone for long, however, as they were soon joined by <strong>Kendall</strong> and <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong>, and publicist pals <strong>Jonathan Cheban</strong>, and <strong>Simon Huck</strong>. The Jenner sibs partied with Kylie’s rumored boyfriend <strong>Tyga</strong> and danced on one another to tunes spun by DJ Samantha Ronson.&nbsp;</p><p>Staying out very, very late, Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17, also gabbed with actor <strong>Michael B. Jordan</strong> and pal <strong>Hailee Steinfeld</strong>. One young Hollywood starlet they didn’t hobnob with was erstwhile frenemy <strong>Selena Gomez</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Changing into a short black minidress with her fresh flower headpiece still in place, the former child star beamed all night and did tequila shots and lots of dance moves with fellow Disney alum <strong>Vanessa Hudgen</strong><strong>s</strong>. Gomez kept the party going with <strong>Reese Witherspoon, Kerry Washington</strong>, and Alba, speaking to each woman individually and letting loose as a group.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Washington had a long, intimate conversation with Gomez as her husband <strong>Nnamdi Asomugha</strong> looked on. Gomez and Witherspoon devoted more time to dancing than chatting, breaking it down to <strong>Lykke Li</strong>‘s “I Follow Rivers.” Jordan popped back up for more tequila shots with Gomez and Hudgens, and spent the better part of an hour dancing with the two ladies, before <strong>Dianna Agron</strong> joined in.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The Glee hottie was hardly the only blonde beauty at the afterparty, of course, as <strong>Jaime King</strong> and <strong>Diane Kruger </strong>also made appearances. Although she’s pregnant with her second child, the Hart of Dixie star still managed to shut down the party at the very end, sipping water as she socialized all night with her husband Kyle Newman and four buddies.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Kruger also stunned at the Boom Boom Room, turning heads with her longtime love <strong>Joshua Jackson</strong>. The Dawson’s Creek alum canoodled with the actress and model, holding her and rocking back and forth after he had some bro time with a group of guy friends.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Stepping away from the scene, <strong>Jennifer Connelly</strong> gossiped with Givenchy designer <strong>Riccardo Tisci</strong> and three friends on the roof deck. The group critiqued stars’ body-baring and daring looks from the Met Gala, strategizing for future fashion ventures.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=334 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Jennifer Connelly" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As the night went on, the party just heated up with additional appearances from <strong>Elizabeth Banks, Naomi Campbell, Matt Bomer, Kate Mara, Emily Blunt, Gigi Hadid, Adriana Lima</strong>, and even New York City mayor <strong>Bill de Blasio</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKarKlivaa%2B0bJko6eYo3qurdieqWalkaCybrvUrWSsnZyau6J5xqiknrJdobK1v4ylpqirlWKutXnMnqtmqJGnwbp5kWlobm1l</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-clooneys-mom-gushes-about-fiance-amal-alamuddin-lovely-2014284.html><span>←</span><span>George Clooney's Mom Gushes About Fiance Amal Alamuddin: &amp;quot;Lovely&amp;quot;</span></a>
