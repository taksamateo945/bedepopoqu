This Thursday, Anstead posted a picture of herself in the mirror writing that during such an “isolating year,” she has many people accusing her of being an “absent mother” because she doesn’t have her kids around as much as she should.</p><p>Anstead, who broke up with her ex-husband, Ant, earlier this year, went on to say in her post, “SMH, wake up people.” Christina went on to say that she doesn’t post as much anymore because she’s not in a competition to show who is the better parent.</p><p>The reality star says her lack of IG posts means precisely the opposite, that being that she is “present.” Fans of the Flip or Flop star know she has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13-month-old child named Hudson London,</a> whom she shares with Ant Anstead.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CHN43RnDW0F/</p><p>Additionally, she is the co-parent of Brayden James and Taylor Reese who she had with Tarek El Moussa. Christina’s split with Tarek El Moussa was even more controversial than her split with Ant because Tarek and Christina came to prominence as the hosts of Flip or Flop.</p><p>Regarding her defense of herself against social media trolls, Christina urged users to not shame parents and to avoid peeking their noses in other people’s lives despite not knowing what’s really going on. Anstead wrote, “take it all with a grain of salt.”</p><p>According to Christina, there are a lot of “filters and fake smiles” on social media, and appearances don’t always reflect the true reality. Christina argued that a lot of people are simply really good at “masking” what’s really going on.</p><p>As it was previously reported, Christina filed for divorce from Ant Anstead this week. The reality star was in the headlines once again <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when it was revealed that she purchased a yacht called Aftermath.</a></p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Last month, Tarek El Moussa was asked whether Christina would be invited to his marriage with Heather Rae Young, and Tarek said he and Heather thought it would be better to have a “smaller” wedding.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTnb%2Bqv9OipZplkaPAtbHAnWStqpGotaa%2FjKymnKGRoXquscOimGato5q%2FtHnWoaZmmZOYwrSxjKGcq2Wfm3qjscinnmaZnmKuo7%2FEp6tmpZ%2Bptaa%2BjG1sa3Bja3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-apothecary-diaries-season-1-episode-5-release-date.html><span>←</span><span>The Apothecary Diaries Season 1 Episode 5: Release Date, Time &amp;amp; Where To Watch Preview</span></a>
