UJ students make Ramaphosa proud with Jerusalema challenge</strong></h3><p class=align-left>President <a href=#>Cyril Ramaphosa</a> recently called on South Africans to continue flying the SA flag high by dancing along to Master KG and Nomcebo's Jerusalema. This after the song became a national and international success.</p><p class=align-left>Ever since then, there have been an influx in clips of people getting their Jerusalema on. While there have been many failed attempts, most people seem to know exactly how to move their bodies to the beat.</p><p class=align-left>The most recent bunch to heed President Cyril's call, are the students of the University of Johannesburg. The crew recently took to their official Facebook page to share the vibey video of themselves breaking it all the way down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/5872190338840aac.jpg><h2><strong>2. Lawyers jam to Jerusalema Challenge</strong></h2><p class=align-left>The Jerusalema challenge has taken the world by storm and everyone, from nurses to firefighters to cops, have been showing off their dance skills to Master KG's hit song.</p><p class=align-left>Now, the Blue Downs Court NPA Group 2 joined the challenge with an amazing video of themselves dancing. On Friday, Janell Cochrane shared the video on her Facebook account. She revealed that although she was not in the video, she filmed it.</p><p class=align-left>In just several days, the video gathered over 40 000 views and South Africans absolutely loved it.</p><h3><strong>3.
